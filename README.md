## Description

It is a terminal game based on classic Worms game. There are 2-4 worms.
They are trying to survive as long as possible and block (kill) their 
opponents. You can play singleplayer agains AI or multiplayer. Multiplayer
game is on one computer on one keyboard or over the network (LAN). Game
using colors and is predisposed to terminal size. 

## What you need to compile it

g++ and ncurses library

## Compile Instruction

All you have to do to make it work is to start "make" comand in your terminal
and the script will compile it for you. All compile instructions are in 
Makefile file. 

It is tested on MAC OS and LINUX systems. It should work on Windows but I haven't
tested it yet. Under Windows you need to change Makefile!!

## Special thanks

I want to thank my friend Lukáš Pohlreich for support. He helped me with some 
algoritms and network problems. 

## End

I hope you will enjoy this game as much as I enjoyed making it.
